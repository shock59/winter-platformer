# Winter Platformer

A very simple platformer game incorporating winter-themed elements like snow. (I hope it looks like a stereotypical winter, winter where I live does not have any snow at all.)

The game is made using HTML canvas and doesn't use any extra libraries (other than Vite and TypeScript). There is only one very short level right now, however it could be expanded in the future to include more. I also made all of the artwork for the game myself in Aseprite. This project was made for Hack Club Siege with the theme "winter".
